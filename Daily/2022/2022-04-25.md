## Discrete Mathematics
- Mathematical induction
  - Well-ordering
  - Weak induction
    - Shows a property P for all natural numbers by showing P(0) and if P(n) then P(n + 1)
  - Strong induction
    - Shows a property P for all natural numbers by showing P(0) and if P(0), P(1) and so on through P(n) then P(n + 1)
- Structural induction
  - Recursive definition
  - Shows a property P for all of a kind of structure by showing P(Empty) and if P(Sub-Structure) and P(Element), then P(Structure(Sub-Structure, Element)), where Structure(Sub-Structure, Element) denotes the structure that consists of the initial sub-structure combined with the element (for a suitable notion of combined).
