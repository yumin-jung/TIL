## Software Prototyping
- Read and write file
- Connection between client and server with Socket.io
    ```
    // /client/main.js

    import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

    const socket = io('ws://localhost:5500');

    socket.on('connect', function (arg) {
    console.log('Client is connected');
    });
    ...


    // /server/index.js
    const fs = require('fs');

    const Server = require('socket.io').Server;

    const socket = new Server(5500, { cors: { origin: '*' } });

    // Listen and speak
    socket.on('connection', function (connection) {
    console.log('Somebody is connected!');
    connection.on('clientMessage', (data) => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    });
    ...
    ```

## Computer Organization
- Need to keep cache consistent with main memory
- Where do you write?
  - Write-through
    - on cache write --> update cache and main memory's block
    - use a write buffer for speed 
    - performance degradation
    - simple to implement
  - Write-back (used more often)
    - on cache write --> update cache, remember block is modified (by dirty bit)
    - if dirty block is replaced, update main memory
    - performance improvement
    - difficult to implement
- How do you write?
  - Write allocate
    - data is overwritten immediately on the cache
  - No-write sllocate
    - main memory is updated immediately
- write-through <-> no-write allocate
- write-back <-> write-allocate
- Read hits: data to read is in the cache
- Handling Cache Misses (Single word blocks)
  - Read misses
    1. stall pipeline
    2. fetch the block from memory
    3. install block in the cache
    4. request word to the processor
    5. pipeline resume
  - Write misses
    - same as Read misses
    - Write-allocate
    - No-write allocate 
- Multiword block
  - Read misses
    - same as single word blocks
    - Miss penalty grows as block size grows
      - Early restart
      - Requested word first
    - Non-blocking cache
  - Word misses
    - If using write allocate
      1. fetch the block from memory
      2. write the word to the block or “garbled” block in the cache
- Reducing Cache Miss Rates --> n-way set associative cache
