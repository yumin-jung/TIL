- Important Aspects of Memory Management
  - Sharing with isolation
  - Protection
  - Transparency
  - Efficiency
- Transparency
  - How? => Relocation

  - Background
    - Compiler
      - compile time
    - Linker
      - compile time
    - Loader
      - load time
- When to Relocate ?
  - Compile time
  - Load time
  - Execution time
- Static Linking
- Dynamic Linking

  - Privileged mode
  - User mode
- How to Manage Base & Limit Registers?
  - Who
    - OS & kernel
    - user process의 경우 바꾸지 못함
      - because protection is violate
  - When
    - context switch가 만들어질 때
- Contiguous Memory Allocation
- Dynamic Storage-Allocation Problem
  - First-fit
  - Best-fit
  - Worst-fit
- Fragmentation
  - External Fragmentation
    - Reduce external fragment by compaction
      - But it has overhead
  - Internal Fragmentation
- Swapping
- Paging
- Address Translation Scheme
  - Page number
  - Page offset
- Free Frames
- TLB
