### Virtual Memory
- Memory can act as a cache for the secondary storage
- Virtual memory implements the translation of a program’s address space to physical addresses
  - --> Enforces protection of a program’s address space from other virtual machines
- Overlays
- A virtual memory block is called a page
- A virtual memory miss is called a page fault
- Many design choices in virtual memory systems are motivated by the high cost of a page fault
  - Pages should be large enough to try to amortize the high access time
  - Allow fully associative placement of pages in memory
  - Page faults can be handled in software
  - Write-through will not work for virtual memory, since writes take too long. Instead, virtual memory systems use write-back
- Page fault
  - Valid bit for a virtual page is off
  - Swap space
    - Space on the disk reserved for the full virtual memory space of a process
  - Operating system creates a data structure that tracks which processes and which virtual addresses use each physical page
    - --> Follow LRU replacement scheme
    - --> But implementing a completely accurate LRU scheme is too expensice
    - --> Most operating systems approximate LRU by keeping track of which pages have and which pages have not been recently used
  - Five techniques that aim at reducing the total maximum storage required as well as minimizing the main memory dedicated to page tables
    1. Keep a limit register that restricts the size of the page table for a given process
    2. Two separate page tables and two separate limits
    3. Apply a hashing function to the virtual address(inverted page table)
    4. Multiple levels of page tables
    5. Page tables to be paged
